## 📝 Project Description

The **Alugames** project simulates an interface for a game rental platform, likely for board games or video games. The main focus of this project is the application of front-end concepts, such as creating an attractive user interface and implementing dynamic interactions, like toggling the rental status of an item.

It is an ideal project to demonstrate skills in responsive design and manipulation of element classes and states using JavaScript.
